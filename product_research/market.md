## Market Opportunity

### Problem: Metastatic Cancer 

"Cancer" is a scary word that associated with a lot fear. "Metastatic" is an extremely devastating adjective to describe a type of cancer. Metastatic cancer is a type of cancer that can spread from part of the body to another. It is a fatal disease that prolonging survival and maintaining the quality of life are the only options of treatments for metastatic cancer patients. 

It is estimated that 42,260 will die from breast cancer this year in the U.S. 90% of those deaths are caused by metastatic breast cancer. Only 25% of patients with metastatic breast cancer will survive in a 5-year period.

We are aiming to provide a platform to support doctors and oncologists effectively cure metastatic cancer at an early stage and prevent patients from reaching the stage where prolonging survivability is the only option. 

### Business Idea

We are going to create computer vision application that can be used to identify whether a digital pathology scan contains a malignant metastatic tissue or not. This application will be targeted for use by cancer professionals at hospitals and cancer research institutes. The revenue model will be a monthly subscription plan for accessing the web-based application. Staff can access the web-based application via credentials specific to their medical institution.

### Why it is important to implement it now ?

 By making use of computer vision to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches from larger digital pathology scans, doctors will be able to identify the best treatment for patients with metastatic cancer at an early stage. Thus, it will significantly reduce the risk of patients reaching the stage where they only have a finite number of time left to spend with his/her love ones. Our application will help eliminating family devastations caused by deaths from metastatic cancers each year. 

## Market Analysis 

### Overview

To give an overview of the market, the global cancer study and research is valued at USD 11.0 billion in 2018 and is estimated to expand at a CAGR of around 13.7% over the forecast period. In addition, the market for AI used for Medical Imaging will reach $2 billion by 2023.

Estimated Calculation:

More than 154,000 women suffering from metastatic cancer in 2018.
That means that a total of 154000 x 200 = 30,800,000 could be spent on early detection of metastatic cancer among just breast cancer patients in the US. 

### Competition

Currently, the hot startups in the space of early cancer detection are focusing on a medical approach such as developing new blood tests to detect cancer at an early stage. They're a very small number of players who employ the use of AI in detecting cancer at an early stage. Based on our research, there are no companies currently tackling the early detection of metastatic cancer. We could be the first to crack into this market. This will allow us to capture a major share of the market. 

#### Major Players

Novartis has invested in various acquisitions and partnerships over the past year, notably a clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate potential treatments in metastatic colorectal cancer. In addition, Tencent has partnered up with Merckâ€™s Biopharma Business to develop an Artificial Intelligence platform to shorten the process of medical treatment metastatic colorectal cancer.

There are many types of metastatic cancers still yet to be tackled such as Kidney, Lung, and Stomach etc. We believe that with the vast amount of data available and our passion to apply AI for early cancer detection, we will be able to develop deep learning applications to detect cancer early.
