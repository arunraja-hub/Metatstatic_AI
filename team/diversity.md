## Diversity

All of us are from Asia, specifically Singapore and Hong Kong. Both of these cities are known for their vibrant multicultural populations. However, we do not have team members who are from the other continents. Thus we are limited in terms of our experience and view of the opportunities in markets outside of Asia.
In addition, our team is entirely made of men. We do not have any female team members so we lack the gender diversity. Yet, we are sure that as our team expends beyond the duration of this course we will be including members of different gender and race.




### How this can impact us

The lack of diversity in our team could affect us in the following 3 areas:
1.	Cultural blind spots: We may not be aware of the needs of people from different cultures. We may tend to focus on the problems faced by Asians
2.	Similar Educational background: All of us are gaining our startup knowledge from the same course in the University of Toronto. Thus we do not have knowledge of the views of academia from other institutions. In addition, all of are Computer Science students.
3.	Same gender: We do not have the opinion of a female cofounder. A female cofounder may have different views based on her experiences which will be useful for the startup



With people of different backgrounds that differ from our own we could do the following:
1.	 gain a more extensive knowledge about the healthcare issues faced in other regions. With that crucial knowledge, we may have been able to target a much larger market in the future
2.	With a varied educational background, we will be able to have different perspectives on the same problem. That way we could have come up with different solutions.
3.	With a female in our team, we will be able to get the perspective of the healthcare issues faced by females.
