Diversity

Diversity is integral to the success of startups. Having a diverse founding team will allow the startup to target a much larger market.


Team Background
---

Our team has a varied background. We have people from multiple continents who speak many languages combined Indian, Chinese and English. 

## Strengths & Weaknesses

Our team has a strong technical background and rich experience in encountering and solving immense problems. We love to experiment cutting-edge technologies and create innovative solutions to solve unique problems. Every member in our team has some experience in developing Machine Learning application in Python, which will enable the team to examine the project from multiple viewpoints effectively and analyzing technical issues and information efficiently.

Each one of us is a team player who are willing to share information, knowledge, and experience; who are committed to work independently toward one goal in unison; who will trust another and move forward together towards the team success. We know that there will be time where we have team conflict, and we all are capable to identify effective strategies to resolve the issues. 

Our team does not have a individual with strong business background who can understand the bigger picture of a business and deliver a feasible marketing and business plan. 


### Subject Matter Experts

Subject matter experts (SMEs) who can help us address our expertise gaps are the following: individuals who have strong background in the health care industry, individuals with strong project management skills, and individuals with strong Machine Learning / Deep Learning knowledge.

As our project theme is based on health care, we would like a specialist in the hospital care who are experts on the stakeholder needs. Our team are interested in developing a Machine Learning application to aid doctor's decision making and predict survival outcome for certain surgeries. This individual will enable the team to better understand how well Machine Learning can solve the health care problems. 

Our team members do not have experience in project management. A Scrum Master or a specialist in project management would help determining the priority of up-coming work such that the team can be more productive.

A Deep Learning specialist would help the team to choosing the correct machine learning model and help us to build a feasible and computation efficient application.


## Diversity

All of us are from Asia, specifically Singapore and Hong Kong. Both of these cities are known for their vibrant multicultural populations. However, we do not have team members who are from the other continents. Thus we are limited in terms of our experience and view of the opportunities in markets outside of Asia.
In addition, our team is entirely made of men. We do not have any female team members so we lack the gender diversity. Yet, we are sure that as our team expends beyond the duration of this course we will be including members of different gender and race.




### How this can impact us

The lack of diversity in our team could affect us in the following 3 areas:
1.	Cultural blind spots: We may not be aware of the needs of people from different cultures. We may tend to focus on the problems faced by Asians
2.	Similar Educational background: All of us are gaining our startup knowledge from the same course in the University of Toronto. Thus we do not have knowledge of the views of academia from other institutions. In addition, all of are Computer Science students.
3.	Same gender: We do not have the opinion of a female cofounder. A female cofounder may have different views based on her experiences which will be useful for the startup



With people of different backgrounds that differ from our own we could do the following:
1.	 gain a more extensive knowledge about the healthcare issues faced in other regions. With that crucial knowledge, we may have been able to target a much larger market in the future
2.	With a varied educational background, we will be able to have different perspectives on the same problem. That way we could have come up with different solutions.
3.	With a female in our team, we will be able to get the perspective of the healthcare issues faced by females.
