## About Shuhang

Hello everyone!

Shuhang is my name and business analytics is my game. I'm a third-year undergraduate hailing from the sunny island of Singapore.

I learned about the NOC program in my freshman year and the idea of working and living overseas independently for a year was really exciting. At the end of my first summer internship with Shopee (an E-commerce platform based in South East Asia), I realized that I enjoy working in an environment with tight-knit and communicative office culture. I picked Toronto because it was a new location offered by NOC and I'm all about taking the leap of faith
